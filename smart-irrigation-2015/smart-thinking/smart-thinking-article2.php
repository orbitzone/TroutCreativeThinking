                        <p>Irrigation systems are an efficient, easy and cost effective way to beautify homes and landscapes. Irrigation systems can contribute to increasing a property&rsquo;s value and save time and money while helping to maintain the initial investment of landscapes.</p>
                        <em>Put away the garden hose and use a professional to set up an efficient watering system. </em>
                        <h5>Secure the landscape investment:</h5>
                        <p>It is not uncommon for home owners to spend thousands of dollars designing and installing a complete landscape for their home but then decide that an irrigation system is not required. An Irrigation system is one of the best investments as it will help to secure the original investment that is put into the landscape. It is a cost-effective way to ensure landscapes are sustained and kept in peak condition. </p>
                        <h5>Improve property value:</h5>
                        <p>Not only do irrigation systems beautify the home by providing luscious gardens and fresh green lawns, an automated irrigation system can add value to properties.</p>
                        <p>The landscape is the first thing that potential buyers see, it can define a street and established landscapes can save the buyer time, energy and money. For these reasons, many real estate agents will claim that a beautiful landscape and an existing irrigation system can have a large impact on the selling price of homes and properties.</p>
                        Some figures:
                        <ul>
                          <li>According to a national survey involving 114 Australian Real Estate agents in 2012, a natural lawn can add 18% or up to $75,000 to the selling price of homes Australia wide </li>
                          <li>Landscaping can add as much as 14% to the resale of a building and speed its sale by as much as 6 weeks.</li>
                          <li>A mature tree can often have an appraised value of between $1,000 and $10,000</li>
                          <li>The economic value of greenspace case study prepared by the Brisbane City Council found &ldquo;leafy streets, with 50 percent more tree cover, added up to $29,000 (5.4 percent) above the median house sale price&rdquo;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Environmental benefits</h5>
                        <p>With green spaces a rapidly growing trend, the benefits of landscapes and gardens are becoming more important to individuals and the environmental benefits progress from this. A healthy, luscious, well-kept garden has several benefits to both the environment and the community.</p>

                              <p>Natural turf has a significant cooling effect. The temperature on a green lawn in midsummer can be 10OC less than bare soil, 20OC less than asphalt, concrete or pebbles and almost 40OC less than synthetic grass.</p>
                              <p>More trees in urban settings also drop temperatures by up to eight degrees, reducing carbon emissions by 12-15 per cent every year.</p>

                              <p>Drip irrigation is an efficient and economical method of watering. Drip irrigation involves placing tubes with emitters in the garden bed or ground alongside the plants. Water is slowly dripped through the emitters directly into the soil at the root zone.
