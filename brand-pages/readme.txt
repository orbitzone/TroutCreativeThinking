Images:
Images for the page are located in the brand named folder.

Recommendations:
Update logos with the brand name in the file name: eg. friatek-logo.jpg
Upload the logo twice the dimension to be displayed in desktop. eg. if the logo displayed is 250px by 250px, it would be better to have the file as 500px by 500px, this is for a better quality on retina display devices. Unless you are using a @2x function to generate this ones.

For each brand page we generate a single css file under css/brand-page folder with the brand name.
