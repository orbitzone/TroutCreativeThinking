					<h2 class="color-ligh-blue">The Reece Grant awards up to $25,000 to support community water projects here and abroad.</h2>
					<p>The Reece Grant is an initiative that aims to improve the quality of life within underprivileged communities by supporting our customers in undertaking projects to provide clean water or improve sanitation.</p>
					<p>In its first year, 2015 saw three plumbers receive grants to help fund international projects in East Timor, India and the Philippines. The projects were a life-changing experience for both the local communities and plumbers involved.</p>
					<p>If you’re a Reece account customer and want to make a difference through a water related project, then we can help you make it happen.</p>
					<p>The grant can take the form of funds or products, so if you are currently undertaking a project or if you have a project in mind, then it’s time to apply.</p>
